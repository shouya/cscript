* BUGS
** DONE conflict solution {
state 6

   10 name: NAME .
   93 function_defination: NAME . '(' parameter_list ')' '{' statements '}'

    '('  shift, and go to state 56

    '('       [reduce using rule 10 (name)]
    $default  reduce using rule 10 (name)


    and the result after reducing is:
    function_call: name . '(' expr_list ')'

    please resolve it. refer what the book says.
}

** DONE `for in' statement should be 1,3 but 0,3
** DONE why cannot a plain function call statement parse? like follows:
a(0); /* cannot recognize */
if (cond) { a(0); } /* can recognize now */
{a(0);} /* okay now */

it's strange, the reason still unkown.



* PLAN
** DONE add `in' operator support
** TODO binary tree module can complete the `traverse' and `count' interface
the traverse should use the in-order method.


* PAY ATTENTION
** the operator `in' in cscript is not like python do, it evaluates from left to right
