BUGS
* `for in' statement should be 1,3 but 0,3
* conflict solution {

state 6

   10 name: NAME .
   93 function_defination: NAME . '(' parameter_list ')' '{' statements '}'

    '('  shift, and go to state 56

    '('       [reduce using rule 10 (name)]
    $default  reduce using rule 10 (name)


    and the result after reducing is:
    function_call: name . '(' expr_list ')'

    please resolve it. refer what the book says.
}

* why cannot a plain function call statement parse? like follows:
a(0); /* cannot recognize */
if (cond) { a(0); } /* can recognize now */
{a(0);} /* okay now */

it's strange, the reason still unkown.
